Dear [Hiring Manager Name or "Hiring Team"],

**Opening:** Lead with a specific reason you're interested in this company or role. Not generic enthusiasm. Reference something real about the company, their product, their mission, or their reputation that genuinely resonates with you.

**Middle 1:** Connect your most relevant experience directly to the core need of the role. Use one concrete example with a metric or outcome. This is not a summary of your resume. It is your single strongest argument for why you can do this job.

**Middle 2:** Address your fit with the team or culture, or speak to a specific challenge the company is facing that you have experience navigating. Show that you understand their world, not just your own.

**Closing:** Express clear interest in next steps. Be direct. Avoid hollow phrases like "I look forward to hearing from you at your earliest convenience." Say what you mean.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
